## JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)

The goal of this implementation is to:
- Provide a clean api for interacting with JOSE tokens
- Follow the existing standard as closely as possible
	- [OpenID Connect](openid.bitbucket.org/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
	- [JWS Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-41)
	- [JWA Spec](tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms)
	- [JWE Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-encryption-17)
	- [JWK Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41)
		- [WebCryptoAPI](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-WebCryptoAPI-20141211/)
	- [JWT Spec](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html)
- Avoid [Critical Security Vulnerabilities in JWT](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/)
	- Disable "none" by default (see below for an example of re-enabling it)
	- Don't rely on "alg" param for identifying verification requirements
	- Implement and check JWK entries with verifiable [kid]s
* [Follow up to Vulnerabilities](https://threatpost.com/critical-vulnerabilities-affect-json-web-token-libraries/111943)

> Although many of the fields are strictly optional we recommend including unique and/or variable data in each token (i.e. at least one timestamp or a unique, random, nonce)

> * A nonce is generated by default unless disabled

## Examples

> Make an empty JWS with None and decode it

> { notice that explicitly enabling the algo is required in both encoding and decoding}

````golang
rem_none := j.RemoveConstraints(j.None_Algo)
jwt := j.New(rem_none)
_, err := j.Decode(jwt.GetToken(), rem_none)
````

## HTTP Basics for Auth

> 401 "Unauthorized" == Unauthenticated i.e. Don't know who you are or don't recognize your token

> 403 "Forbidden" == Unauthorized i.e. Identity known but request rejected

# JWK Info

JSON data structure representing cryptographic key(s)
- Public/Private Keys: RSA & Eliptic Curve
- Symmetric Keys: Octet Sequence

Uses:
- Included in JWS / JWE / JWT Headers ( See [security vulnerability](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/) for why JWK is important to include )
- Published, over TLS, and referenced inside the data set
- Can replace Self-Signed Certificates
- Saved to Disk, Sent Over-The-Wire (email, etc)

> JWK Example [ RSA-SHA256 | Key ID: '9er' | Public Key Uri ]

````json
{"alg":"RS256","kid":"9er","jku":"https://www.example.com/jwks"}
````

## Key Definition Guidelines

Inclusion of both "use" and "key_ops" should be avoided
- Prefer either/or if possible
- If both are included they must match purpose (Sign vs Encrypt)

Duplicate Key_Ops not permitted on a single key
- Field is optional unless needed for processing

Multiple unrelated key ops should be avoided
- If included ops should be complementary
	- "sign" with "verify"
	- "encrypt" with "decrypt"
	- "wrapKey" with "unwrapKey"

Key Id should be unique within a set
- Except in cases where Key Type is different, indicating multiple valid options

Key Types not understood by the server should be rejected outright

TODO:
- WebKey structs for other providers
	- EC: curve, x, y
	- RSA: modulus, exponent
